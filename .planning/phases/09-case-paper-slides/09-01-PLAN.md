<objective>
Write the 3-page case paper (Markdown → PDF-ready) and 6-slide presentation outline for Maritime Hackathon 2026 submission.

**Submission requirements (from hackathon rules):**
- Case paper: Word or PDF, ≤3 pages excluding cover, named `MaritimeHackathon2026_CasePaper_teamname`
- Presentation: PowerPoint, 4-6 slides, ≤10 min, named `teamname_presentation.ppt`
- Deadline: 7 Feb 2026, 09:00 SGT

**Tech available:** Python, PuLP, matplotlib, pandas
**Established patterns:** MILP optimization, epsilon-constraint Pareto, perturbation shadow prices, MACC, safety sweep, carbon sweep
**Key decisions:**
- MILP guarantees optimality (vs greedy heuristic)
- Linearized safety constraint for solver compatibility
- Epsilon-constraint for Pareto frontier (standard OR technique)
- Shadow prices via +1% DWT perturbation, +0.1 safety perturbation
- MACC from Pareto frontier shadow carbon prices

**IMPORTANT:** The case paper must be written using placeholder values (e.g., `{fleet_size}`, `{total_cost}`) for all numerical results since per_vessel.csv from teammates is not yet available. The methodology, structure, figures, and narrative must be complete — only the specific numbers will be filled in after production run.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write case paper in Markdown</name>
  <files>outputs/deliverables/case_paper.md</files>
  <action>
Create outputs/deliverables/ directory and write case_paper.md with the following structure (≤3 pages when rendered):

**Cover section (not counted in 3-page limit):**
- Title: "Smart Fleet Selection: MILP-Based Optimization for Singapore-Australia Bunker Transport"
- Team name: REPmonkeys
- Category: A
- Date: February 2026

**Section 1: Problem Statement & Approach (~1 page)**
- Problem: Select minimum-cost fleet from 108 vessels for Singapore → Port Hedland monthly bunker transport
- Constraints: DWT ≥ 4,576,667t monthly demand, avg safety ≥ 3.0, all 8 fuel types represented, single-use per vessel
- Approach: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (PuLP) with binary selection variables
- Objective function: minimize sum of (fuel_cost + carbon_cost + ownership_cost ± risk_premium) for selected vessels
- Key insight: MILP guarantees provably optimal solution vs heuristic approaches
- Linearized safety constraint: sum(safety_i - threshold) ≥ 0 avoids nonlinear average

**Section 2: Results & Sensitivity Analysis (~1 page)**
- Base case results: fleet of {fleet_size} vessels, total cost ${total_cost}, DWT {total_dwt}t, avg safety {avg_safety}, {fuel_types} fuel types, CO2eq {co2eq}t
- Reference charts: Pareto frontier (Figure 1), fleet composition (Figure 2), safety comparison (Figure 3)
- Safety threshold sweep: compare fleets at 3.0/3.5/4.0/4.5 — cost increases, fleet composition shifts
- Cost-emissions Pareto frontier: 15-point epsilon-constraint sweep showing tradeoff
- Shadow prices: DWT constraint marginal cost, safety constraint marginal cost
- Diversity what-if: cost of requiring all 8 fuel types vs unconstrained

**Section 3: Beyond the Brief (~1 page)**
- Carbon price sensitivity: $80/$120/$160/$200 sweep with fleet recomposition
- MACC (Marginal Abatement Cost Curve) from Pareto data — identifies cheapest emissions reductions
- Fleet efficiency metrics: cost/DWT, CO2/DWT, capacity utilization
- Policy implications: higher safety standards increase costs by X%, carbon pricing shifts fleet toward cleaner fuels
- Recommendation: optimal fleet balances cost, safety, and emissions; further tightening safety to 4.0 may be worthwhile given marginal cost

Use `{placeholder}` syntax for ALL numerical results — these will be filled after production run with real data. Include figure references like "(see Figure 1: Pareto Frontier)" pointing to the chart filenames.

Write in concise, professional academic style. No filler. Every sentence adds information.

  <verify>File exists at outputs/deliverables/case_paper.md, contains all 3 sections plus cover, all chart references present, placeholder syntax used for numbers</verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write presentation slide deck outline</name>
  <files>outputs/deliverables/presentation_outline.md</files>
  <action>
Write presentation_outline.md as a structured Markdown outline for 6 slides (≤10 min presentation):

**Slide 1: Title**
- "Smart Fleet Selection: MILP-Based Optimization"
- Team REPmonkeys, Category A, Maritime Hackathon 2026

**Slide 2: Problem & Approach**
- Problem: 108 vessels, 4 constraints, minimize cost
- Visual: constraint diagram or decision variable illustration
- Key point: MILP guarantees optimality

**Slide 3: Base Case Results**
- Fleet: {fleet_size} vessels, ${total_cost}, {avg_safety} safety
- Visual: Key metrics table
- Key point: all constraints satisfied with proven optimal cost

**Slide 4: Sensitivity Analysis**
- Safety sweep: cost impact of raising threshold from 3.0 → 4.5
- Visual: safety_comparison.png or fleet_composition.png
- Key point: safety-cost tradeoff is quantified

**Slide 5: Beyond the Brief**
- Pareto frontier (cost vs emissions tradeoff)
- MACC chart (cheapest abatement opportunities)
- Carbon price sweep (policy scenario analysis)
- Key point: fleet selection is robust across carbon price scenarios

**Slide 6: Recommendations & Conclusion**
- Optimal fleet balances cost, safety, emissions
- Shadow prices quantify constraint costs
- Fuel diversity adds ${diversity_cost} but ensures supply resilience
- Next steps: apply to real operational planning

For each slide, include:
- Title
- 3-4 bullet points (speaker notes)
- Suggested visual/chart reference
- Timing guide (total = 10 min)

Use {placeholder} for all numbers.
