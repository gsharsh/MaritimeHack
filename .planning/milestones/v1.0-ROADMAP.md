# Milestone v1.0: Maritime Fleet Optimizer

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

MILP-based fleet optimization for the Maritime Hackathon 2026 Smart Fleet Selection challenge. Selects minimum-cost fleet of ships to transport bunker fuel from Singapore to Australia West Coast, subject to DWT demand, safety, and fuel diversity constraints. Includes Pareto frontier analysis, safety threshold sweep, carbon price sweep, and submission output generation.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Clean Slate & Data Foundation

**Goal**: Remove placeholder code, set up SOP constants/lookup tables, build test fixtures, create per_vessel.csv adapter
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Delete placeholder code & create constants/lookup tables (2 tasks)
- [x] 01-02: Build test fixtures & per_vessel.csv adapter (2 tasks)
- [x] 01-03: Update run.py, config, verify end-to-end (2 tasks)

### Phase 2: MILP Fleet Optimizer

**Goal**: Replace greedy solver with PuLP MILP. Binary decision variables, minimize total cost, DWT/safety/fuel diversity constraints.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: TDD — Build select_fleet_milp() with PuLP binary MILP (TDD plan)
- [x] 02-02: Wire MILP into run.py, fix column defaults, add CLI args (2 tasks)

### Phase 3: Validation

**Goal**: Run MILP on test fixtures and verify checkpoint vessel costs, fleet solution ranges, and constraint satisfaction.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Validation test suite & full regression check (2 tasks)

### Phase 4: Safety Threshold Sweep

**Goal**: Re-run MILP at safety thresholds 3.0/3.5/4.0/4.5, record fleet metrics, detect infeasible thresholds.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Implement safety sweep function and wire into CLI (2 tasks)

### Phase 5: Cost-Emissions Pareto Frontier

**Goal**: Epsilon-constraint method sweeping CO2eq cap in 15 steps, shadow carbon prices, carbon price sweep at $80/$120/$160/$200.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Epsilon-constraint Pareto sweep + shadow carbon prices (2 tasks)
- [x] 05-02: Carbon price sweep + CLI wiring (2 tasks)

### Phase 6: Submission & Charts

**Goal**: Fill submission CSV, generate matplotlib charts (Pareto frontier, fleet composition, safety comparison).
**Depends on**: Phase 4, Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Submission CSV + Pareto frontier chart (2 tasks)
- [x] 06-02: Fleet composition bars + safety comparison table chart (2 tasks)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- PuLP MILP over greedy solver (guarantees optimal solution)
- Linearized safety constraint: sum(safety_i - threshold) >= 0
- CO2eq cap as optional parameter to existing select_fleet_milp()
- Min-emissions bound via dedicated MILP (_solve_min_co2)
- Shadow carbon price = marginal cost per tonne CO2eq reduced
- Carbon price adjustment via final_cost recalculation
- Submission CSV preserves 4-column template format
- Charts use matplotlib Agg backend for headless CLI

**Issues Resolved:**
- None — clean execution across all phases

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant — codebase is clean hackathon-scope code
