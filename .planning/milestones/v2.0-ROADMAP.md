# Milestone v2.0: Submission Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 7-10
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Enhance optimizer outputs with shadow prices, additional charts (MACC, fleet composition), what-if analyses, and produce final deliverables (case paper + slides) for Maritime Hackathon 2026 submission. Culminates in full production run with 108-vessel dataset and independent constraint validation.

## Phases

### Phase 7: Shadow Prices & What-If Analyses

**Goal**: Extract shadow prices via perturbation (DWT & safety constraints), run drop-diversity what-if, compute cost-per-DWT efficiency metrics
**Depends on**: v1.0 complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Shadow prices, diversity what-if, fleet efficiency + CLI wiring — 2026-02-06

### Phase 8: Enhanced Charts

**Goal**: MACC from Pareto data and carbon price sweep dual-subplot chart
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (needs sensitivity data with fleet lists)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: MACC chart, carbon sweep chart, wire into run.py — 2026-02-06

### Phase 9: Case Paper & Slides

**Goal**: Write 3-page case paper and 6-slide presentation deck using all generated outputs
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (needs all charts and analysis numbers)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Case paper + presentation outline — 2026-02-06

### Phase 10: Final Validation & Submission

**Goal**: Re-verify all 4 constraints independently, generate all outputs end-to-end, fill placeholders, package deliverables
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Run production pipeline, fill placeholders, validate constraints — 2026-02-06

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- DWT shadow price via +1% perturbation, safety shadow price via +0.1 perturbation
- Diversity what-if toggles require_all_fuel_types True vs False
- MACC bars sorted cheapest-first, color thresholds: <$100 green, $100-$500 yellow, >$500 red
- Carbon sweep chart: dual subplot (cost + emissions), infeasible shown as text
- All deliverable numbers use {placeholder} syntax for production-run fill
- Case paper structured as 3 sections matching hackathon requirements

**Issues Resolved:**
- None — clean execution across all phases

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant — codebase is clean hackathon-scope code

**Production Results (108 vessels):**
- 21 vessels selected, $19,706,493.72 total cost
- 4,577,756t DWT, 3.24 avg safety, 8 fuel types
- 13,095.28t CO2eq emissions
- All 4 constraints independently validated
