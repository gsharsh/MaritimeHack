# Maritime Hackathon 2026 - Smart Fleet Selection
# Global parameters (override with actual hackathon data when provided)

# Cargo demand: monthly bunker tonnes (from MPA Annual Report 2024, Page 10, distributed over 12 months)
# Example: 49.83 M tonnes/year -> 4.15 M tonnes/month
cargo_demand_tonnes: 4150000  # Update from MPA 2024 report

# Route: Singapore (A) to Australia West coast (B) - single voyage, no return/round trips
route:
  origin: Singapore
  destination: Australia_West_Coast

# Carbon price (2024 European Exchange) USD per tonne CO2 equivalent
carbon_price_usd_per_tco2e: 80

# Ship life and finance
ship_life_years: 30
# Asset depreciation rate (r), Capital Recovery Factor (CRF) - to be filled from data
# CAPEX: base by DWT range, multiplier by main_engine_fuel_type

# Constraints
constraints:
  min_avg_safety_score: 3.0   # Average fleet safety score >= 3 (1=highest risk, 5=least risk)
  require_all_fuel_types: true # At least one vessel of each main_engine_fuel_type
  each_ship_once: true        # No repeat trips

# Sensitivity: stretch objective - re-run with different min_avg_safety_score (e.g. 4.0)
sensitivity:
  enabled: false
  safety_scores_to_try: [3.0, 4.0]
