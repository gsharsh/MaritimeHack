<current_state>
Project initialized but no roadmap or milestone created yet.

Completed so far:
1. `/gsd:new-project` — created `.planning/PROJECT.md` with full hackathon context
2. `/gsd:map-codebase` — created `.planning/codebase/` docs (ARCHITECTURE, CONVENTIONS, STACK, etc.)
3. Attempted `/gsd:new-milestone` but it failed because no ROADMAP.md exists yet

The `.planning/` directory is in `.gitignore` — planning files are local only.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- PROJECT.md: Full project definition for Nickolas's optimization module
  - MILP fleet optimizer (Step 7), Pareto frontier (Step 8), Safety comparison (Step 10)
  - Key constants, data handoff format, constraints, team structure all documented
- Codebase mapping: ARCHITECTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, STACK.md, STRUCTURE.md, TESTING.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, CONCERNS.md
- config.json: mode=yolo, depth=comprehensive
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

1. **Create roadmap** (`/gsd:create-roadmap`) — this is the next step
   - Will define phases for the MILP optimizer, Pareto frontier, safety comparison, etc.
   - Depth setting is "comprehensive" (8-12 phases) but given hackathon deadline (7 Feb 09:00 SGT), "quick" (3-5 phases) may be more appropriate
2. **Plan phases** (`/gsd:plan-phase`) — after roadmap exists
3. **Execute plans** (`/gsd:execute-plan`) — the actual coding work
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- PuLP MILP over greedy solver (guarantees optimal solution)
- Replace existing src/optimization.py with MILP version
- Test with 5 checkpoint vessels before real per_vessel.csv arrives
- MONTHLY_DEMAND = 4,576,667 tonnes
- matplotlib for charts, pandas for data
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- per_vessel.csv not yet available from teammates (build with test fixtures first)
- Deadline is 7 Feb 2026 09:00 SGT — extremely tight timeline
</blockers>

<context>
This is a Maritime Hackathon 2026 project. Nickolas is responsible for Steps 7, 8, and 10:
- Step 7: MILP base fleet optimizer (minimize cost, subject to DWT/safety/fuel constraints)
- Step 8: Cost-Emissions Pareto frontier (epsilon-constraint, 15 steps)
- Step 10: Safety threshold comparison (safety >= 4.0 vs >= 3.0)

The existing codebase has a greedy solver in src/optimization.py that needs to be replaced.
Team is splitting work — teammates produce per_vessel.csv, Nickolas consumes it.

Config is set to yolo+comprehensive but given the deadline, consider switching to quick depth
or just skipping GSD formality and coding directly.

<next_action>
Resume options (pick one):

**Option A — Use GSD workflow:**
1. Run `/gsd:create-roadmap` to define phases
2. Then `/gsd:plan-phase` for each phase
3. Then `/gsd:execute-plan` to build

**Option B — Skip GSD, just build (recommended given deadline):**
1. Ask Claude to implement the MILP optimizer in src/optimization.py using PuLP
2. Build test fixtures from 5 checkpoint vessels
3. Implement Pareto frontier analysis
4. Implement safety threshold comparison
5. Generate submission CSV and charts

Given the deadline (hours away), Option B is likely the pragmatic choice.
Start with: "Implement the MILP fleet optimizer in src/optimization.py using PuLP"
